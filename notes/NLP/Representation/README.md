## Sentence Embedding

1. [**SimCSE: Simple Contrastive Learning of Sentence Embeddings**](https://github.com/iofu728/PaperRead/blob/master/paper/NLP/Representation/TianyuGao_[X]_SimCSE.pdf) [x] _Tianyu Gao, Xingcheng Yao, Danqi Chen_.
   - Using two independent dropout to generate the contrastive learning positive pairs.
   - Contrastive learning theoretically regularizes pretrained embeddingsâ€™ anisotropic space to be more uniform.
   - Supervised version SimCSE use label=entailment and label=contradiction.
   - The improvement of performance is significant.
