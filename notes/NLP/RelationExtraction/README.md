   - How to solve relation extraction task by using BERT
   - three representation
     1. standard BERT
     2. add Position embed
     3. Entity Mark
   - three output
     1. CLS output
     2. Mention level pooling
     3. Mention start
   - random replace the Entity -> `[BLANK]`
   - negative sample

   - using the middle sentence to represent the relation of the pair.
   - choose one temperate to do the cloze task.

   - Start-end + Multi-time => RL. The model also a pipeline model.
