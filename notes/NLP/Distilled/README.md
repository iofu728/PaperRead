1. [**DeFINE: DEep Factorized INput Word Embeddings for Neural Sequence Modeling**](https://github.com/iofu728/PaperRead/blob/master/paper/NLP/Distilled/DEFINE.pdf) [ICLR 2020] _Sachin Mehta, Rik Koncel-Kedziorski, Mohammad Rastegari, Hannaneh Hajishirzi_.
   - reduce the input and output embed size.
   - add one multi-layer FC to improve the representation.
   - for getting multi-grain representation(dense and sparse), design one HGT architecture.
   - split and mixed group representation to residual connections.
