1. [**K-BERT: Enabling Language Representation with Knowledge Graph**](https://github.com/iofu728/PaperRead/blob/master/paper/NLP/KnowledgeBases/K-BERT.pdf) [AAAI 2020 Reject] _Weijie Liu, Peng Zhou, Zhe Zhao, Zhiruo Wang, Qi Ju, Haotang Deng, Ping Wang_.
   - change previous word embedding + TranE => add knowledge to sentence(Like annotations)
   - The change maybe have noisy in semantic. So add one mask.
   - The improvement of performance is little.
