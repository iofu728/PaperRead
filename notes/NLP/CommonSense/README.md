1. [**KagNet: Knowledge-Aware Graph Networks for Commonsense Reasoning**](https://github.com/iofu728/PaperRead/blob/master/paper/NLP/CommonSense/KagNet.pdf) [EMNNLP 2019] _Bill Yuchen Lin, Xinyue Chen, Jamin Chen, Xiang Ren_.
   - Pre-trained model have latent ability in common sense task.
   - using GCN -> find best path -> LSTM -> Hierarchical Path-base Attention
   - concate the pertained representation.
2. [**How Large Are Lions? Inducing Distributions over Quantitative Attributes**](https://github.com/iofu728/PaperRead/blob/master/paper/NLP/CommonSense/QuantitativeAttributes.pdf) [ACL 2019] _Yanai Elazar, Abhijit Mahabal, Deepak Ramachandran, Tania Bedrax-Weiss, Dan Roth_.
   - Rule-base Quantitative Detection, but good than SOTA.
