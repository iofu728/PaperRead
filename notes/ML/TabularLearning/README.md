1. [**TabNet: Attentive Interpretable Tabular Learning**](https://github.com/iofu728/PaperRead/blob/master/paper/ML/TabularLearning/TabNet.pdf) [submit ICLR 2020] _Sercan O. Arik, Tomas Pfister_.
   - Neural Network Method in Tabular Learning
   - without any feature process and use conventional gradient descent-based optimization.
   - utilize sequential attention mechanism choose which feature to reason from.
   - continual learning
   - interpretable
     - local interpretable
       - how feature combine
     - global interpretable
       - the contribution of each input feature.
   - classification and regression
