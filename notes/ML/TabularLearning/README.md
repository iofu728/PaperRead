   - Neural Network Method in Tabular Learning
   - without any feature process and use conventional gradient descent-based optimization.
   - utilize sequential attention mechanism choose which feature to reason from.
   - continual learning
   - interpretable
     - local interpretable
       - how feature combine
     - global interpretable
       - the contribution of each input feature.
   - classification and regression
