# Metric Learning

1. [< Constellation Loss >](https://github.com/iofu728/PaperRead/blob/master/paper/ML/MetircLearning/ConstellationLoss.pdf) [NIPS]
   - when we use the multi-class n pair loss, the num of negative is fixed. because of using the the same class to be the negative sample.
   - And the controlled parameters K, means we can change the computational effort in the model.
