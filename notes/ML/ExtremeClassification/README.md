# Extreme Classification

1. [**Extreme Classification via Adversarial Softmax Approximation**](https://github.com/iofu728/PaperRead/blob/master/paper/ML/ExtremeClassification/extreme_classification_via_adversarial_softmax_approximation.pdf) [ICLR 2020] _Robert Bamler, Stephan Mandt_.
   - adversarial negative sample in extreme classification.
   - auxiliary task to make negative sample is uniform by decision tree.
   - proof the negative sample loss = constant + original loss.
   - proof the best signal-to-nosie in the gradient is obtained is auxiliary model is best.
