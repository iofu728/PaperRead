# Video Prediction

1. [**Efficient and Information-Preserving Future Frame Prediction and Beyond**](https://github.com/iofu728/PaperRead/blob/master/paper/CV/VideoPrediction/CrevNet.pdf) [submit ICLR 2020]. _Anonymous_.
   - reduce origin pixel-wise prediction computational
   - take advantage of 3D CNN info
   - introduce a two-way autoencoder which can reduce memory demand and computational cost, but also no information loss in theoretically guaranteed.
   - propose reversible predictive modules(RPM).
